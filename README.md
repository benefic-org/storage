# Hex Storage

This library is designed for increasing the speed of Application development by creating a unified library that replaces the ORM, KeyValue, and Block storage solutions needed to build modern apps. Without futher ado, here are a few code snippets of what you can do with this library:


_Object Relational Model Storage:_

```swift

class User: Model {

    @Attribute var name: String
    
    @Attribute var 
}
```

_Key Value Storage:_

```swift
class Settings {

    @KeyValue var
    
}

```
_Block Storage:_

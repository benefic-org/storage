# Hex Storage
</center>

https://trello.com/b/4htzSFYK/hex-storage

This library is built for app development by providing a simple and unified API for:

* Object Relationship Model Storage
* Key Value Storage
* **[ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§]** Block / Binary Storage

With the following high-level features:

* Local Data Persistence
* Cloud Data Persistence
* Peer To Peer Data Sharing
* Public Data Sharing 
* E2EE
* HIPPA Compliance

With support for multiple backing technologies on multiple platforms, this library is defined to dramatically reduce the amount of time spent picking and using ORMs, KVs, or Block / Binary oriented data.

## Examples:

Here are a few code snippets of what you can do with this library:


### Object Relational Model Storage:

```swift
import HexStorage

class User: Model {
    
    @Attribute var createdOn: Date

    @Attribute var name: String
    
    @NullableAttribute var viewedCounter: Double?
}
```

### Key Value Storage:

```swift
import HexStorage

class Settings {

    @KeyValue var shouldDisplayOnboarding: Bool
    
}

```
### **[ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§]** Block Storage:

(Coming Soon)
